eCharacter
==========

eCharacter is an open-source game character configuration tool

Select from a library of base animated 3D characters, customize them
with a simple graphical user-interface, similar to those found in many
computer games, and export a selection of animations and views 
to standard formats.

Although initially designed with eAdventure in mind, the tool should be
straightforward to integrate into any other game authoring platform.
